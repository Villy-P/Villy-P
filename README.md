# Hello!

My name is Valerius Petrini, and I'm a high school software developer with a passion for open source development. I specialize in languages like **Typescript**, **C++**, and graphical tools like **OpenGL**.

Some of my current projects I'm developing are **Visual Studio Code extensions**, an **interactive fiction game engine** written in C++, and a **custom compiler** for a programming language I am making in C. You can find most of my completed projects on **Github**, where contributions from other developers are always welcome.

My ultimate goal is to create tools that help other developers accelerate their workflow, leading to more innovation and development in the software ecosystem. I am also passionate about educating others on computer science topics, which I share on my **Blog**.

Outside of programming, I love spending time outdoors and with friends and family. Feel free to browse my open-source repositories or connect with me to work together on innovative projects!
